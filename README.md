the one and only project I am working on

The vision of this game made me start programming out of nowhere (i was only playing games before) and it turns out that i love it.

I dont expect to get this game "done"(well playable) before 2020 and i dont know if it will ever be as good as i believe it will be, but I will just keep working on it and keep learning with it.
